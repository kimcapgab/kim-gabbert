          Hi, I'm Kim Gabbert.

        <p>
          I'm a current student at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, with an expected graudation date of January 31, 2022.
          Prior to making this transition to Software Engineer, I was a CPA and worked with a variety of accounting software and applications.
          Part of my role included implementation of the applications, as well as training and tech support for our clients. Although I enjoyed these
          aspects of my job, I aspired for more, which led me to General Assembly. At General Assembly, I have improved my coding skills and have added
          languages to my skill set and am currently learning more.
