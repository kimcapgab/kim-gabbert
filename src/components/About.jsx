        <p>
          Coming from an accounting and implementations background, my previous roles allowed me to research
          and help customers select the best software that met their needs. This thirst for knowledge and passion
          for solving problems led me to start a new career in Software Development, giving me the ability to
          design real-world applications with customers in mind. With five years of professional experience,
          working in various environments from start-ups to large corporations, I am ready to help a team achieve
          their goals while expanding my knowledge and skill sets to build a long-term career.
