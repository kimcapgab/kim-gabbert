          Hi, I'm Kim Gabbert.

        <p>
          Coming from an accounting and implementations background, my previous roles allowed me to research
          and help customers select the best software that met their needs. This thirst for knowledge and passion
          for solving problems led me to start a new career in Software Development, giving me the ability to
          design real-world applications with customers in mind. With five years of professional experience
          working in various environments from large corporations to start-ups, I am ready to help a team achieve
          company goals and to expand my knowledge and skillset to build a long-term career with a forward-thinking company.
